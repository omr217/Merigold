# ðŸ“¸ Real-Time Depth Estimation with Marigold and Webcam

This project captures live webcam video and generates corresponding **depth map visualizations** using the [Marigold Depth LCM model](https://huggingface.co/prs-eth/marigold-depth-lcm-v1-0). The output is saved as an animated `.gif`, making it easy to observe temporal depth changes in a short sequence.
